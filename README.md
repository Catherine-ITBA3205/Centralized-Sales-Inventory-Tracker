This project was built to give solutions for companies that still rely on spreadsheets to keep records of their sales and inventory data. It is a web-based platform that will provide you with a centralized database, that  allows you to generate reports automatically, provide a point of sales system, and recommend what specific product you should produce in a peak season. This project is useful for business owners because it allows shopkeepers to keep track of their purchases and sales. Mismanaged inventory results in dissatisfied customers,  and slower sales. This project will be able to track sales and available inventory, tell a shopkeeper whenever it's time to replace or how much to consider purchasing, and completely remove paper work, human errors, and manual delays.  The system is only intended to run on Windows, which must have a supported browser of Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer, 4GB of RAM, and a CPU speed of 1.9 GHz or higher.
